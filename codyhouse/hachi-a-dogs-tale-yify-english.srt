From the travelers,
the vendors, and we will
take care of it for him.

JASJEET: The station square
is Hachi's home now.

1055
01:16:26,249 --> 01:16:29,586
Every day he comes,
same time, same place,
here only.

You'll do that for him?

Of course.

then I...

He was a good friend.

1064
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,951
I understand how you feel.

1065
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:06,206
Hachi, my friend,
Parker is never coming home.

then Hachiko should wait.

don't you?
